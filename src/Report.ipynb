    "According to research some of the most important and most widely used input features for VTP (in addition to timestamps, latitude and altitude) are SOG, COG, heading, ship type and information about ports (Yang et al, 2024, p. 7).  \n",

    "The same paper also mentioned that some of the most used approaches to VTP are LSTM networks and its variants, especially bidirectional variants (Yang et al, 2024, p. 7). This is mostly because VTP can be approached as a time series problem because the data always contain a temporal dimension (Yang et al, 2024, p. 7).\n",
